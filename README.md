Apple's Vision 2030: Becoming a Carbon Neutral Corporation
# Brief Introduction
Apple Corporation aim to make their products carbon neutral by 2030 - they set their baseline at 38.4 million metric tons in fiscal year 2015 to reduce it to 75% by 2030 and the remaining 25% to be removed by carbon offsets across their corporate operations and entire product life cycle. So, I have been tasked by Maven Analytics Team to their progress towards achieving that as an Independent Journalist and as a Data Viz Enthusiast.
## Brief Overview of the dataset
Data was provided by Maven Analytics Team. The dataset is structured and contains 3 tables in CSV format - Greenhouse gas emissions, Carbon footprint by product, and Normalizing factors. Each table has at least 4 columns each which consist of : Fiscal Year, Category, Release Year, Product, etc. Also, the dataset contained data dictionary to help understand the data better.
