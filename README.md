Apple's Vision 2030: Becoming a Carbon Neutral Corporation
# Brief Introduction
Apple Corporation aim to make their products carbon neutral by 2030 - they set their baseline at **38.4 million metric tons** in fiscal year 2015 to reduce it to **75%** by 2030 and the remaining **25%** to be removed by carbon offsets across their corporate operations and entire product life cycle. So, I have been tasked as an Independent Journalist and as a Data Viz Enthusiast by Maven Analytics Team to visualize their progress towards achieving their aim.
## Brief Overview of the dataset
Data was provided by Maven Analytics Team. The dataset is structured and contains 3 tables in CSV format - Greenhouse gas emissions, Carbon footprint by product, and Normalizing factors. Each table has at least 4 columns each which consist of : Fiscal Year, Category, Release Year, Product, etc. Also, the dataset contained data dictionary to help understand the data better.
## Problem Questions
*  What are the gross emissions and carbon neutral trend over the fiscal years and has their been any significant progress so far and how? 
*  What are the rates of product life cycle and corporate emissions over these fiscal years?
*  What is the relationship between the generated revenue and total emissions over the fiscal years and how has this contributed to Apple's goal so far?
*  What has been the scope rates and has their been any significant reduction in the total emission?
## Tool used
Tableau
## Processes
*  Imported the csv files into Tableau
*  Checked for correct data types, errors, and duplicate values
*  Data visualization

## Key Insights
*  Here are some **key metrics** from the analysis.

*  We are seeing a downward trend over the **fiscal years** from **2015 to 2022** - **46.3%** out of the targeted **75%** of the 2015 total gross emissions - **38.4M metric tons**, and **11.1%** of the remaining **25%** by carbon offsets had been reduced. Hence, this has been a positive outcome so far.

*  Product life cycle emitted the most by **98.8%** compared to Corporate emissions which had **1.2%**.

*  The generated revenue over the fiscal years had skyrocketed by  **45.3%** compared with the downward trend of the total emissions. This really tells us that more reduction from the total emissions would generate more revenue for Apple Corporation in achieving their goal.

*  **99.76%** of the total emissions came from Scope 3; which represents manufacturing(purchased goods and services), transportation and distribution, etc. Out of all these, manufacturing emitted **73.89%** from the total gross emissions and only **16.2M metric tons** of CO2e had been reduced.

## Recommendation
I would suggest that Apple should focus more on the reduction of Scope 3 emissions, most especially manufacturing of purchased goods and services. As it was seen that most emissions emanated from there.
